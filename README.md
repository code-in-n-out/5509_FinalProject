Breast Cancer Diagnosis Prediction
Project Description
The primary goal of this project is to perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) dataset to understand its structure, detect patterns, and identify key features that distinguish malignant from benign tumors. The ultimate aim is to gain insights that lay the foundation for building predictive models to support early and accurate breast cancer diagnosis.
